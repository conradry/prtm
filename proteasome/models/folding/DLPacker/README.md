This repo contains the code from DLPacker paper [DLPacker: Deep Learning for Prediction of Amino Acid Side Chain Conformations in Proteins](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.23.445347).

<h2 align="center">What can this code do?</h2>

* Restore full-atom protein structure from backbone (packing)
* Generate structures of point mutants (assumes the backbone has not changed)
* Pack or refine parts of protein structure (e.g. after you modelled backbone of a missing loop)
* Restore partially of fully missing side chains (to be implemented)
* *probably more*


Input may contain any protein/protein complex/RNA/DNA/small molecules etc. Only water molecules are removed by default and MSE residues are renamed into MET, the rest will stay the same (except side chains of course).


<h2 align="center">Usage</h2>

As easy as three lines of code:

```python
from dlpacker import DLPacker
dlp = DLPacker('my_structure.pdb')
dlp.reconstruct_protein(order = 'sequence', output_filename = 'my_structure_repacked.pdb')
```

Input stricture might or might not contain side chains, existing side chains, if present, will be ignored.

You can find more examples with explanations in the jupyter notebook **[DLPacker.ipynb](DLPacker.ipynb)**.

**Key dependencies:**
* tensorflow 2.x
* biopython

This repo does not contain neural network's weights due to their large size. You will need to download them from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J4fV9aAr2nssrWN8mQ7Ui-9PVQseE0LQ/view?usp=sharing).
