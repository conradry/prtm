        "# AlphaFold Colab\n",
        "\n",
        "This Colab notebook allows you to easily predict the structure of a protein using a slightly simplified version of [AlphaFold v2.3.2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2). \n",

        "**Differences to AlphaFold v2.3.2**\n",
        "\n",
        "In comparison to AlphaFold v2.3.2, this Colab notebook uses **no templates (homologous structures)** and a selected portion of the [BFD database](https://bfd.mmseqs.com/). We have validated these changes on several thousand recent PDB structures. While accuracy will be near-identical to the full AlphaFold system on many targets, a small fraction have a large drop in accuracy due to the smaller MSA and lack of templates. For best reliability, we recommend instead using the [full open source AlphaFold](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold/), or the [AlphaFold Protein Structure Database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/).\n",
        "\n",
        "**This Colab has a small drop in average accuracy for multimers compared to local AlphaFold installation, for full multimer accuracy it is highly recommended to run [AlphaFold locally](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold#running-alphafold).** Moreover, the AlphaFold-Multimer requires searching for MSA for every unique sequence in the complex, hence it is substantially slower. If your notebook times-out due to slow multimer MSA search, we recommend either using Colab Pro or running AlphaFold locally.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please note that this Colab notebook is provided for theoretical modelling only and caution should be exercised in its use. \n",
        "\n",
