That's not usually an issue when working with individual structures but can be limiting when trying to train models on GPUs with finite memory. In practice, most models use a denser 14 atom representation of the structure. The only disadvantage here is that the identity of an atom depends on the residue in question. The mapping of atoms is specified by `proteome.constants.residue_constants.restype_atom14_to_atom37`. Let's see how much space using 14 atoms saves us."
