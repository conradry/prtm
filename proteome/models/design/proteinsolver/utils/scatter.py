    r"""Aggregates all values from the :attr:`src` tensor at the indices
    specified in the :attr:`index` tensor along the first dimension.
    If multiple indices reference the same location, their contributions
    are aggregated according to :attr:`name` (either :obj:`"add"`,
    :obj:`"mean"` or :obj:`"max"`).

    Note:
        This method was copied from torch-geometric v1.3.0 to maintain
        backwards-compatibility.

    Args:
        name (string): The aggregation to use (:obj:`"add"`, :obj:`"mean"`,
            :obj:`"max"`).
        src (Tensor): The source tensor.
        index (LongTensor): The indices of elements to scatter.
        dim_size (int, optional): Automatically create output tensor with size
            :attr:`dim_size` in the first dimension. If set to :attr:`None`, a
            minimal sized output tensor is returned. (default: :obj:`None`)
