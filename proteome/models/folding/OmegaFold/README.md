# OmegaFold: High-resolution de novo Structure Prediction from Primary Sequence

#### This is the release code for paper [High-resolution de novo structure prediction from primary sequence](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.21.500999v1).

We will continue to optimize this repository for more ease of use, for
instance, reducing the GRAM required to inference long proteins and
releasing possibly stronger models.

## Update Notes

### Model 2 release notes Dec 9. 2022

Now you can use model 2 by setting `--model 2` in the command line!

### Huge GRAM reduction

We have optimized (to some extent) the GRAM usage of OmegaFold model in our
latest release. Now the model can inference protein sequence as long as
_4096_ on NVIDIA A100 Graphics card with 80 GB of memory with
`--subbatch_size` set to 448 without hitting full memory.
This version's model is more sensitive to `--subbatch_size`.

### Setting Subbatch

Subbatch makes a trade-off between time and space.
One can greatly reduce the space requirements by setting `--subbatch_size`
very low.
The default is the number of residues in the sequence and the lowest
possible number is 1.
For now we do not have a rule of thumb for setting the `--subbatch_size`,
but we suggest half the value if you run into GPU memory limitations.

### MacOS Users

For macOS users, we support MPS (Apple Silicon) acceleration if the user
installs the latest nightly version of PyTorch.
Also, current code also requires macOS users need to `git clone` the
repository and use `python main.
py` (see below) to run the model.

## Setup

To prepare the environment to run OmegaFold,

- from source

```commandline
pip install git+https://github.com/HeliXonProtein/OmegaFold.git
```

- clone the repository

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/HeliXonProtein/OmegaFold
cd OmegaFold
python setup.py install
```

should get you where you want.

The `INPUT_FILE.fasta` should be a normal fasta file with possibly many
sequences with a comment line starting with `>` or `:` above the amino
acid sequence itself.

This command will download the weight
from https://helixon.s3.amazonaws.com/release1.pt
to `~/.cache/omegafold_ckpt/model.pt`
and load the model

## Running

You could simply

```commandline
omegafold INPUT_FILE.fasta OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
```

And voila!

### Alternatively (Or MacOS users)

Even if this failed, since we use minimal 3rd party libraries, you can
always just install the latest
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and [biopython](https://biopython.org)
(and that's it!) yourself.
For mps accelerator, macOS users may need to install the lastest nightly
version of PyTorch.
In this case, you could run

```commandline
python main.py INPUT_FILE.fasta OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
```

### Notes on resources

However, since we have implemented sharded execution, it is possible to

1. trade computation time for GRAM: by changing `--subbatch_size`. The
   smaller
   this value is, the longer the execution can take, and the less memory is
   required, or,
2. trade computation time for average prediction quality, by changing
   `--num_cycle`

For more information, run

```commandline
omegafold --help
```

where we provide several options for both speed and weights utilities.

## Output

We produce one pdb for each of the sequences in `INPUT_FILE.fasta` saved in
the `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`. We also put our confidence value the place of
b_factors in pdb files.
